# Chapter 8 - Implementation Issues (I)

## Notes

### Something To Think About

***Standard implementation techniques are entirely inadequate to create source code.***

## Exercises

### Exercise 8.1

Describe how each of the issues in Section 8.3 applies to your personal computerâ€™s hardware and software configuration.

#### Solution

This is already explained in the book, no need to describe how each one of the issues applies to my PC. Skip.

### Exercise 8.2

Find a new product or system that manipulates transient secrets. This might be the same product or system you analyzed for Exercise 1.8. Conduct a security review of that product or system as described in Section 1.12, this time focusing on issues surrounding how the system might store these secrets (Section 8.3).

#### Solution

Skip.

### Exercise 8.3

Find a new product or system that manipulates secret data. This might be the same product or system you analyzed for Exercise 1.8. Conduct a security review of that product or system as described in Section 1.12, this time focusing on issues surrounding code quality (Section 8.4).

#### Solution

Skip.

### Exercise 8.4

Monitor the bugtraq mailing list for one week. Create a table listing all the different types of vulnerabilities that are announced or fixed during that week, as well as the number of such vulnerabilities for each type. What sorts of larger inferences can you draw from this table? See http://www.schneier.com/ce.html for additional information about the bugtraq mailing list.

#### Solution

Just keep checking [Schneier's website](https://www.schneier.com/) for one week, otherwise skip.
