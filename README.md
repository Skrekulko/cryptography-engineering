# Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications

### What Is It About

Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications is a book, or rather a textbook, about designing and implementing cryptographic security systems. The authors hope to educate you not only how to design and implement, but also how to think like a cryptographer/security engineer. This book offers a highly practical understanding of the security environment from a cryptography standpoint.

### What Is The Purpose

As part of my self-study in the immense field of security engineering, I will share my thoughts on the book as well as my own solutions to the supplied exercises. Many things in the book I already know/understand, but as history has shown us, *practice makes perfect*.

### Something To Think About

***A security system is only as strong as its weakest link.***
