# Chapter 13 - Introduction to Cryptographic Protocols

## Notes

### Something to think about

*When working on protocols, you must assume that you are dealing with the enemy.*

## Exercises

### Exercise 13.1

Describe a protocol you engage in on a regular basis. This might be ordering a drink at a local coffee shop or boarding an airplane. Who are the explicit actors directly involved in this protocol? Are there other actors involved peripherally in this protocol, such as during the setup phase? For simplicity, list at most 5 actors. Create a matrix, where each row is labeled by an actor and each column is labeled by an actor. For each cell, describe how the actor in the row trusts the actor in the column.

#### Solution

It's not really necessary to write this down... Skip.

### Exercise 13.2

Consider the security of your personal computer. List the attackers who might break into your computer, their incentives, and the associated costs and risks to the attacker.

#### Solution

Same as before. Skip.

### Exercise 13.3

Repeat exercise 13.2, except for a bank instead of your personal computer.

#### Solution

Again? Skip.

### Exercise 13.4

Repeat exercise 13.2, except for a computer at the Pentagon instead of your personal computer.

#### Solution

Are you kidding me? Skip.

### Exercise 13.5

Repeat exercise 13.2, except for a computer belonging to a criminal organization instead of your personal computer.

#### Solution

Finally, the last one. Skip.
