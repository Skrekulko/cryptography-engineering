# Chapter 15 - Implementation Issues (II)

## Exercises

### Exercise 15.1

Consider all the operations a computer might perform with a cryptographic key. Which ones might have timing characteristics that could leak information about the key?

#### Solution

For example [AES cache timing attack](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5401353), or attacks that exploit the difference in the amount of time it takes to retrieve data from cache rather than main memory.

### Exercise 15.2

Find a new product or system that manipulates secret data. This might be the same product or system you analyzed for Exercise 1.8. Conduct a security review of that product or system as described in Section 1.12, this time focusing on issues surrounding side-channel attacks.

#### Solution

Skip.
